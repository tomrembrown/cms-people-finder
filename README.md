# Ashroh People Finder

People can sign up or login. After this they are brought to a personal webpage which they can configure. Here they can list interests and other details - which they can then search for other
people based on similar interests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

1. Ensure node nd yarn are installed. Since lerna is built on yarn, this uses yarn as the package manager. Node must be at least version 14. This project is just static pages with a contact page - so it does not contain any database.

2. Clone GIT repository and download

```
git clone https://github.com/tomrembrown/cms-people-finder.git
cd cms-people-finder
```

3. Download and install packages in various directories, and copy files to create .env - which can be done with the following command

```
yarn initial
```

4. Adjust parameters in .env as necessary (note .env files exist in all of client, server, and database)

5. Determine port postgres runs on

```
linux:  sudo netstat -plunt |grep postgres
or in psql terminal type \conninfo
```

6. Build PostgreSQL database, create user, and give user permissions

```
su - postgres (enter postgres user password)
psql --port (port determined for postgresql server)
OR psql -h localhost(or other host name) -U (user able to create databases) --port (port - if not default 5432)
CREATE DATABASE people_finder;
CREATE ROLE pf_computer_access WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD (enter password here in single quotes);
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE people_finder TO pf_computer_access;
ALTER ROLE "pf_computer_access" WITH LOGIN;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext WITH SCHEMA public;
\c people_finder
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
```

7. Create the database tables

```
yarn run createTables (from root directory)
```

8. a) Development - For development mode, start the servers (command from root directory starts both vue & express servers).

```
yarn run dev
```

8. b) Production - For production mode, first build the bundles

```
yarn run build
```

Second, for production, on the server, run the server using pm2 (process manager) using:

```
yarn run server
```
